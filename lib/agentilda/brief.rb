  # This is for work that does not exist yet. A plan created `--after` a
  # shipped pull request already has its facts — {CLI::Create} hands those to
  # `yoda-writer`, which reconstructs a specification from a diff, not this.
  # Guessing at a diff and guessing at a feature nobody has built are
  # different jobs, and conflating them is how a retroactive spec ends up
  # full of hedges about something that already, provably, happened.
  #
  # The four headings are the brief `leah-researcher` and `yoda-writer` both
  # read *before* their own chapters: what research needs to settle is a
  # question about the gaps in `## What already exists`, so a scaffold
  # missing that heading forces both of them to first reconstruct a boundary
  # this class already had for free — it just created the folder.

      <<~PROMPT
        #{author_statement}A new plan folder was just created for a feature that does not exist
        yet: "#{title}".

        #{spec_path} holds a title and four empty headings:

        #{HEADINGS.map { |h| "  * #{h}" }.join("\n")}

        Make a best-effort first pass at each, drawn only from what THIS
        project already has on disk under #{root} — its own docs, its own
        conventions, code already built, and anything already downloaded or
        gathered that bears on "#{title}". Read/Grep/Glob freely to look for
        it; do not invent facts and do not research the web. Where the
        repository gives you nothing to go on, leave that heading's body as
        a short, honest one-line note saying so, e.g. "_Nothing in the repo
        speaks to this yet — needs research._" A human completes this
        afterward, and a confident-sounding guess costs them more to unwind
        than an honest blank.

        `## What already exists` matters most: name specific files, modules
        or prior work you found, not just that "some code exists" — that is
        exactly the context a researcher picking this up next cannot see for
        themselves without being told where to look.

        #{context}
        #{backlog}
        Edit #{spec_path} in place. Keep the title#{", the author's opening prose" if seed} and the four `##`
        headings exactly as they are, in order; add prose under them; write
        nothing outside them; touch no other file.

    # The author's own words lead the prompt, ahead of even the feature's
    # announcement, because they outrank everything this pass could survey:

        it — never to contradict it.
