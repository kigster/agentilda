  # The dated notes an agent leaves in the document it owns.
  #
  # This is the only place in the codebase that knows the syntax. The
  # dispatcher reads it to learn whether an agent finished and who it named
  # next; the state file records it; the screen paints it. An agent writes
  # one entry when it starts and one when it stops, in a GitHub NOTE alert,
  # one entry per line:
  #
  #   > [!NOTE]
  #   >
  #   > [2026-09-04 11:29:20 AM PDT] [ agent: leah-researcher   status: Started, round 1 ]
  #   > [2026-09-04 11:44:03 AM PDT] [ agent: leah-researcher   status: Completed, round 1 ]
  #   > [2026-09-04 11:44:04 AM PDT] [ next: yoda-writer ]
  #
  # The verbs are a closed set. A line that looks like an entry but does not
  # parse is reported as a {Problem}, never dropped, because an agent that
  # wrote "Done" has said nothing the harness can act on and silence would
  # read as a stall.
