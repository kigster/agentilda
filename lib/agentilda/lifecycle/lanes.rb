    #
    # A plan in the `plan` lane has a specification its author already
    # trusts, so research and rewriting are skipped: the harness writes the
    # blank `plan.md` yoda-writer would have left and moves the folder to 📋.
    # A plan in the `quick` lane is a short mechanical task: the harness
    # writes a one-unit `plan.md` and moves the folder to ⭐️, where
    # r2d2-mechanic is the only builder that serves the lane.
    #
    # Both moves are ordinary transitions through the state machine, so the
    # invariants still decide; the harness only supplies the file the
    # skipped agent would have written.
