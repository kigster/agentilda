    # The one channel two agents on the same plan have to each other.
    #
    # `luke-backend` and `rey-frontend` build one plan in one worktree at the
    # same time, but each is its own `claude -p` process. Claude Code can
    # message between local sessions, and the prompts used to say so, but a
    # session is named after its directory plus a random suffix, so a pair had
    # to guess its partner from a list of every session on the machine by start
    # time. It worked once, by luck. With ten plans running there would have
    # been ten `agentilda-xx` entries and nothing to tell them apart.
    #
    # So the mailbox lives in the plan folder, append-only, one numbered entry
    # per message, readable by `agentilda mail read` during the round and by a
    # person after it. The harness names the partner in each agent's prompt,
    # so nobody guesses.
    #
    # Messages are kept in the plan's `state.json` ({PlanState}), next to the
    # stages and signatures a restart reads. Plans from before that kept them
    # in `mailbox.md`; those are still read, and numbering carries on from
    # them, but nothing writes there any more.
