    # a program can read without parsing prose.
    #
    # Three kinds of record live here, written by three kinds of writer:
    #
    #   stages      the harness: one per agent per round, Started when it is
    #               dispatched and settled when it returns, with the adapter,
    #               model, effort, tokens and seconds it ran on
    #   signatures  the agents, through `agentilda state sign`: the ledger
    #               lines they used to append to plan.md and spec.md
    #   messages    the agents, through `agentilda mail send`: what a pair
    #               says to each other, and the RESUME notes an interrupted
    #               agent leaves for its successor
    #
    # A stage still Started whose harness process is gone is a crash, which is
    # how a restarted run finds what it has to resume.
    #
    # The folder name stays the source of truth for the plan's state; `state`
    # here is the last state the harness moved the folder to, kept so the file
    # is readable on its own.
    #
    # Every write takes a lock, re-reads, changes, and renames a temporary file
    # over the old one, so two agents signing in the same second cannot lose
    # each other's line, and a reader never sees half a file. The lock lives in
    # the system temp dir, keyed by the plan's number, because the folder it
    # protects is renamed under it as the plan moves.
