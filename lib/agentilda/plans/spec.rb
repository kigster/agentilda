    #     build:  { adapter: codex, model: gpt-5-codex, effort: medium }
    #     review: { model: opus }
    #   implementation_suggestions:
    #     - Ruby, with dry-cli for the command line
    #     - Reuse the gems already in the Gemfile before adding new ones
    #   implementation_requirements:
    #     - The database is PG-strict
    #   task-completed-when:
    #     - `tilda create` opens an editor and writes no draft

    #     - bundle exec rspec spec/agentilda/cli/create_spec.rb
