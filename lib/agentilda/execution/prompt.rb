          Claim each directory or file before you write it, and release it when
          that write is done. Name yourself on every call, since `alock` would
          otherwise sign with a fingerprint your sub-agents share; give each
          sub-agent its own suffix, e.g. `AGENT_ID=#{agent.name}-schema`:

              AGENT_ID=#{agent.name} alock acquire <path> "<why>"
              AGENT_ID=#{agent.name} alock release <path>

          A refused `acquire` means another agent holds it: work on something
          else, never write it anyway. Before your closing signature, run
          `AGENT_ID=#{agent.name} alock release-all`.

          ## The ledger - sign at the start and at the end

          You sign this plan's `state.json`, through the command below. Never
          edit `state.json` by hand: the command takes a lock, so you and an
          agent working beside you cannot overwrite each other. Run it by the
          path given, not as a bare `agentilda`: the one on your PATH may be an
          older release without these commands, and wherever your instructions
          say `agentilda`, they mean `#{cli}`. Before you do any work:

              #{sign} --status Started

          When you finish:

              #{sign} --status Completed#{handoff}

          Sign `Completed` only if your assignment is genuinely done. Otherwise
          use `--status "Almost completed"`, `Interrupted` or `Blocked`, with no
          `--next`. Where your instructions say to sign `Blocked, round N
          (technical)` or `Completed, round N (approved)`, pass the words in
          parentheses as `--note technical` or `--note approved`. The harness
          renames the plan folder and starts the next agent from these
          signatures; you never rename the folder yourself.

          ## Mailbox - poll it between steps

          #{who}. You share one worktree and one branch, but not a process, so
          the only way to reach each other is the plan's mailbox, kept in the
          plan's `state.json`. Use the commands; never edit the file by hand.

          Read it before each significant step and whenever you finish a unit:

              #{cli} mail read --dir "#{plans_dir}" --plan #{plan} --for #{agent.name}

          Pass `--after N`, with the number of the last message you have read,
          to see only what is new. Write to it when you land an interface your
          partner is waiting on, when you amend the contract, when you need
          something from their half, and when you finish:

              #{cli} mail send --dir "#{plans_dir}" --plan #{plan} --from #{agent.name} --to #{partners.first.name} "what you need them to know"

          Every message is appended with a number and a timestamp and never
          edited, so a person can read the exchange after the round. A question
          your partner has not answered within a few steps is not a reason to
          stop: write your assumption into implementation-plan.md and carry on.

          Read this file before each significant step. Empty means carry on.

          finish the essential remainder now. STOP means write what you have,
          sign your ledger entry, and end your turn.

          INTERRUPT means the operator pressed Ctrl-C and the run will be started
          again later. Start nothing new. Finish the write you are in the middle
          of, so no file is left half-written, then leave a resume note for
          whoever runs next — most likely you — saying what is done, what is
          not, and the exact next step:

              #{cli} mail send --dir "#{plans_dir}" --plan #{plan} --from #{agent.name} --to #{agent.name} "RESUME: ..."

          Then sign `--status Interrupted`, with no `--next`, and
          end your turn.

          Before you start, check for such a note from an earlier run:

              #{cli} mail read --dir "#{plans_dir}" --plan #{plan} --for #{agent.name}

          If there is a RESUME note, continue from it and do not redo what it
