# Agentilda repository guide

Agentilda is a Ruby gem whose `tilda` CLI creates feature briefs and coordinates specialist coding agents toward pull requests. Human operators merge. The seven role definitions live in `agents/`.

## Setup and verification

The current `.ruby-version` selects Ruby 4.0.6. Activate rbenv before Ruby commands:

```bash
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
bundle check
# If dependencies are missing:
bundle install
just ci
```

`just ci` runs RuboCop and RSpec with coverage. CircleCI configuration is in `.circleci/config.yml`. Prefer `.agent/saul-gooodman` as the gate if that script is added. Do not infer the current test baseline from historical failures in `CLAUDE.md`.

`bin/setup` can install tooling and dependencies. The `ratatui_ruby` native dependency requires Rust, clang and libclang; README documents the jemalloc include workaround.

```

Folder names encode lifecycle state. Preserve one definition of invariants in `status.rb` and topology in `state_machine.rb`; regenerate documentation with `just update-workflow`. Agents supply roles through frontmatter. Network seams are injected in tests; filesystem tests use actual temporary directories.

Commands generally preview changes until `--commit`; configuration can affect effective behavior, so inspect CLI help before executing runs. Worker agents cannot merge. The publisher, not the worker, owns pushing.

`CLAUDE.md` contains useful design history but stale setup and repository-status claims. Read current files before relying on those claims. For the proposed scheduler, Jev, independent review, Braintrust and eval changes, read [the factory proposal](docs/software-factory-proposal.md). Those changes are not implemented yet.

## Distribution

This is a gem, not a deployed web service. `just build` runs setup; `gem build agentilda.gemspec` builds a package. `just publish` publishes to RubyGems and uses 1Password or an explicit OTP. `just release` tags and publishes a GitHub release and currently force-updates tags. Publishing and release require an explicit release request. Update the guide when those commands change.

Keep `.env` and credential values out of commits, prompts and telemetry. Preserve pre-existing local changes when preparing a PR.
