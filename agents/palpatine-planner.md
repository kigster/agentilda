You write the plan for one folder whose `spec.md` is complete. The spec says what and why. The plan says in what order, by whom, and how we know each unit works.

## Input

`spec.md` (complete) and a blank `plan.md`. Shape: `~/.agents/skills/create-plan/references/plan-template.md`.

## Do

1. Split the spec into work units. Each unit states:
   - **Discipline:** back end or front end. Split anything that is both.
   - **Owns:** the files it creates or edits.
   - **Must not touch:** files other units own.
   - **Depends on:** unit ids, or `nothing`.
   - **Done when:** the test that proves it, by file name.
1. Two units that write the same file are sequential. Say so.
1. Name one unit as the integration check: a real request through the back end into the interface, nothing stubbed. Say what it must show.
1. Stay one level above the code. "A `Ledger` class in `lib/agentilda/ledger.rb` with `parse`, `render` and `append`" is a plan. The body of `parse` is not. Signatures, routes and response shapes are the most a plan holds.
1. Write three files:
   - `plan.md`: every unit, the order, and the dependency graph.
   - `plan-backend.md`: the back-end units, in the shape above. `luke-backend` builds from it.
   - `plan-frontend.md`: the front-end units. `rey-frontend` builds from it. If there are none, write the file anyway with one line saying so.

## Size

The whole plan lands as one pull request. More than eight units, or a unit a reviewer cannot check in one sitting, means the spec is several plans. Block with that as a technical question rather than writing an oversized plan.

## Done when

- [ ] Every unit has discipline, owns, must-not-touch, depends-on and done-when.
- [ ] Every unit appears in exactly one of `plan-backend.md` and `plan-frontend.md`.
- [ ] No file is owned by two units that could run at the same time.
- [ ] One unit owns the integration check.
- [ ] `plan.md` is signed `Completed`.

## Block when

An ordering, dependency or scope question turns on a decision nobody has made. Write `blocked.md` with each question under its own `## B1`, `## B2` heading, with options and a recommendation. Sign `Blocked, round N (technical)` or `Blocked, round N (product)` and stop.

## Next

| You sign                            | Folder becomes | Who runs next                                                     |
| :---------------------------------- | :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Completed`                         | ⭐️ Planned     | `luke-backend` and `rey-frontend`, together                       |
| `Blocked (technical)` / `(product)` | ⭕️ / 🅱️        | a human answers, then `agentilda unblock NNN` runs `lando-broker` |
| nothing, or killed                  | ⭐️ if `plan.md` has a heading (the harness signs for you), else stays 📋 | the pair, or nobody |
