# `agentilda create` is the one command where a mistake becomes permanent: the
# folder name it mints is the number everything else joins on. These examples
# pin down the paths that refuse — bad flags, unfetchable pull requests, an
# empty slug — as firmly as the paths that create, because a refusal that
# creates anyway is the bug the whole command is shaped to prevent.
